# Switchence's future
As you can obviously tell, Switchence is barely being updated these days. I may reboot it in the near future, but for now Switchence woll be publicly archived. Keeping up with current games when I don't even use my Switch is hard to do, so I apologize. If someone wants to create an up-to-date database PLEASE message the owner of the Discord server linked below!! I'd love if someone else could help out with the work! A good alternative to Switchence is [MCMi460/NSO-RPC](https://github.com/MCMi460/NSO-RPC)

## Why sunset Switchence?
Truthfully, I've lost almost full motivation to work on Switchence. Working with the code I created when I first learned Python is very hard to do. I tried to refactor a good chunk of the code base in v1.10.0 to make my life easier, but what Switchence really needs is a full recode. Doing a full recode would take a lot of work that truthfully I don't want to do. Switchence was fun, good project for me to improve my coding skills with, and it was! I learned quite a lot from this project and had a lot of fun working on it! Maybe one day I'll do a full recode for v2.0.0 like I wanted to make so long ago.

# Switchence
Switchence is a **simple** Nintendo Switch rich presence app that allows you to show what game you're playing on Discord. What makes this better than other Discord rich presence apps is that this one **auto-updates** its game list whenever you start it so you don't have to create your own Discord app, add your own images and edit the json file.

# Features
## Auto-updating üîÑ
Not only does the program auto-update itself, but its game list does as well! This ensures sure you're always up to date with the latest version.

## Growing game list ‚¨ÜÔ∏è
Not only is the game list huge already, it's being actively updated for all of the latest big game releases. If you want to add a game you can make a [game request](https://github.com/Aethese/Switchence#game-requests-).

## Easy setup üòå
The program is easy to set up for your friend code and has many options built into the program. You can view all of the available settings by typing 'options' in the set game input.

## Very fast üèÉ
Switchence is very fast! Staying as fast as possible, so you don't have to wait at all for the program to load.

## Good code documentation üìÑ
Good code documentation that allows for other developers to add onto Switchence so the app is always improving!

If you like this project and would like to support it, there are multiple ways you could do that. You could star this repository, support me on [Patreon](https://patreon.com/aethese) and get access to beta builds, or join the the [Discord server](discord.gg/238heBqmZb)!

# Game Requests üéÆ
I do take requests for games. All you have to do is create an [issue](https://github.com/Aethese/Switchence/issues/) with the title being "Game Request" and the game name in the description. I should be able to add your game in the next game list update soon after I see your request!

## Wrong/bad image for a game?
Let me know! I'd prefer if you could find one that's at least 512x512 to help me out because searching for good game images can be hard sometimes. But if you say it looks bad and I agree I'll change it!

# Find an error? ‚ùå
Report it! You can do so by creating an [issue](https://github.com/Aethese/Switchence/issues/) so I can figure out how to help you and/or fix the problem for the next release!

# Supported OS üñ•
I currently support **Windows** and **Linux** officially for this app. It may or may not work for Mac. If it doesn't work for Mac, there is no guarantee I can fix the incompatibility issue.

# Contributions ‚ù§Ô∏è
I'd love to get some help! I'm not the most advanced programmer out there so I'd love some support with my project! Anything from minor spelling fixes to bigger code improvements are welcomed at all time. Your pull request will be reviewed soon after you send it in so you can get some fast feedback.
