# Switchence
**Simple** Nintendo Switch rich presence app for Windows that allows you to show what game you're playing on Discord. What makes this better than other Discord rich presence apps is that this one **auto-updates** it's game list whenever you start it so you don't have to create your own Discord app, add your own images and edit the json file. You also have the ability to have the program auto update or you can get notified if their is a new update available for the program. What's great about this is that you can still use the program you have currently installed even if it is a lower version!

# Prerequisites
* Download the latest version from [releases](https://github.com/Aethese/Switchence/releases/)
* A Discord account and the Discord desktop app
* An internet connection
* Everything in the *requirements.txt* file
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Requests
I do take requests for games. All you have to do is create an issue with the title being "Game Request" and the game name in the description. I should be able to add your game in the next game list update (around a week or as soon as I see it)!

# Find an error?
Report it! You can do so by creating an [issue](https://github.com/Aethese/Switchence/issues/) so I can figure out how to help you and/or fix the problem for the next release!

# Supported OS
I currently only support **Windows** for this app. It currently doesn't work for Linux or Mac but I have plans on making it work soon.

# Inspiration
Most inspiration from this project came from myself, but also [this](https://github.com/Da532/NS-RPC) repo. I recommend to check it out :) *it looks better lol*

# Future Plans
### These are the major future plans for the program
- [ ] Add Mac support
- [ ] Add Linux support
- [ ] Version 2.0.0 (big overhaul)
