# READ ME
This entire project is still a WIP :)

# Switchence
**Simple** Nintendo Switch rich presence app that allows you to show that you're playing it on Discord. What makes this better than other Discord rich presence apps is that this one auto-updates it's game list whenever you start it so you don't have to create your own Discord app, add your own images and edit the json file.

# Prerequisites
* A Discord account
* An internet connection
* Empty file called "sw-code.txt"
* Empty file called "version.txt"

### If you are using the source code:
* A Discord Account
* An internet connection
* Python version 3.7+ with pip
* Everything in the requirements.txt file
* Download or make your own copy of the sw-code.txt file (keep it empty)

# Requests
I do take requests for games. All you have to do is create an issue with the title being "Game Request" and the game name in the description

# Inspiration
Most inspiration from this project came from myself, but also [this](https://github.com/Da532/NS-RPC) repo. I recommend you check that it out :) *it has more games and looks better lol*
