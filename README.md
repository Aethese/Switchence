# Switchence
Switchence is a **simple** Nintendo Switch rich presence app that allows you to show what game you're playing on Discord. What makes this better than other Discord rich presence apps is that this one **auto-updates** it's game list whenever you start it so you don't have to create your own Discord app, add your own images and edit the json file.

# Features
## Auto updating
Not only does the program auto update itself, its game list does aswell! This makes sure you're always up to date without having to go to the GitHub page or fix the issues yourself.

## Growing game list
Not only is the game list huge already, it's being actively updated for all of the latest releases. If you want to add a game you can make a [game request](https://github.com/Aethese/Switchence#game-requests).

## Easy setup
The program is easy to set up for your friend code and many options built into the program. You can view all of the available settings by typing 'options' in the set game input.

## Very fast
The program is very fast! Staying as fast as possible so you don't have to wait at all.

## Active community
Have a question, issue or [game request](https://github.com/Aethese/Switchence#game-requests)? Well ask away because you are guaranteed to get a response within a day or two!

# Game Requests
I do take requests for games. All you have to do is create an [issue](https://github.com/Aethese/Switchence/issues/) with the title being "Game Request" and the game name in the description. I should be able to add your game in the next game list update soon after I see your request!

# Find an error?
Report it! You can do so by creating an [issue](https://github.com/Aethese/Switchence/issues/) so I can figure out how to help you and/or fix the problem for the next release!

# Supported OS
I currently support **Windows** and **Linux** officially for this app. It may or may not work for Mac. If it doesn't work for Mac their is no guarantee I can fix the incompatibility issue.
