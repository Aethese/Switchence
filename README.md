# READ ME
This entire project is still a WIP :) [Version 1.0.0](https://github.com/Aethese/switchence/releases) should be releasing soon along with the source code and exe file along with it.

# Switchence
**Simple** Nintendo Switch rich presence app that allows you to show what game you're playing on Discord. What makes this better than other Discord rich presence apps is that this one **auto-updates** it's game list whenever you start it so you don't have to create your own Discord app, add your own images and edit the json file. You also get notified if their is a new update available for the program. What's great about this is that you can still use the program you have currently installed even if it is a lower version!

# Prerequisites
* A Discord account
* An internet connection

### If you are using the source code:
* A Discord Account
* An internet connection
* Python version 3.7+ with pip
* Everything in the *requirements.txt* file

# Requests
I do take requests for games. All you have to do is create an issue with the title being "Game Request" and the game name in the description. I should be able to add your game in the next game update (around a week or as soon as I see it)!

# Find an error?
Report it! You can do so by creating an [issue](https://github.com/Aethese/Switchence/issues/) so I can figure out how to help you and/or fix the problem for the next release!

# Inspiration
Most inspiration from this project came from myself, but also [this](https://github.com/Da532/NS-RPC) repo. I recommend you check that it out :) *it has more games and looks better lol*
